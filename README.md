## Notes

### Command Usage Explanation
Basically, everything in `[]` is optional. Everything in `<>` is required.

The most complex command you can have (for `mg!create` anyways) is `mg!create #giveaways -w 2 2m Test`, which creates a giveaway in #giveaways with 2 winners and will last 2 minutes. It will have the title "Test".

The least complex is `mg!create 60 Test`, which creates a giveaway for 1 minute with 1 winner in the current channel. It will have the title of "Test".
